In this assignment I created a code that designed and implementated a library of Python functions that could
manipulate character strings.

To do this I first had to inclued the following constants:
  ASCII_LOWERCASE = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
  ASCII_UPPERCASE = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
  DECIMAL_DIGITS = “0123456789”

Next was including these following functions:
  is_alpha ( str ) ==> bool
  is_digit ( str ) ==> bool
  to_lower ( str ) ==> bool
  to_upper ( str ) ==> bool
  find_chr ( str, str ) ==> int
  find_str ( str, str ) ==> int
  replace_chr ( str, str, str ) ==> str
  replace_str ( str, str, str ) ==> str
The notation above gives the name of each function, the number and type of its argument(s),
and the type of its return value.

These were the main things I had to use, and what I took away from the project was not just how to create a library but also that they can reduce development time by providing code that’s already been tested and used. For example, instead of writing complex data handling functions, you can use the Pandas library for data manipulation.
